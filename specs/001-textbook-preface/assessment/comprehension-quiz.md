## Question 1: Physical AI Definition (FR-001, SC-001)

**Question**: What is the primary difference between traditional AI and Physical AI?

**Options**:
- A) Processing speed and computational power
- B) Physical embodiment - minds with bodies ✅ **CORRECT**
- C) Programming language used (Python vs C++)
- D) Cost of hardware and development

**Learning Objective**: Students analyze the distinction between disembodied AI (minds without bodies) and Physical AI (embodied intelligence)

**Bloom's Level**: Analyze

**Explanation**: Traditional AI exists as "a ghost in the machine—brilliant but bodiless," while Physical AI combines minds and bodies, enabling robots to interact with the physical world through embodiment.

## Question 2: Three Technological Convergences (FR-002, SC-002)

**Question**: Which three technological "tsunamis" enable Physical AI? (Select 3)

**Options** (multiple select):
- A) Foundation Models (GPT, Claude, LLaMA) ✅ **CORRECT**
- B) Blockchain and cryptocurrency
- C) Simulation Environments (Isaac Sim, Gazebo) ✅ **CORRECT**
- D) Edge Computing (Jetson, on-device neural networks) ✅ **CORRECT**
- E) Quantum Computing
- F) Social Media platforms

**Learning Objective**: Students recall and identify the three technological convergences (Foundation Models, Simulation, Edge Computing) from memory

**Bloom's Level**: Remember

**Success Threshold**: 80%+ recall (SC-002)

**Explanation**: Physical AI is enabled by (1) Foundation Models providing reasoning and language understanding, (2) Simulation Environments for safe training, and (3) Edge Computing for on-device processing without cloud dependency.

## Question 3: Why Humanoid Robots? (FR-003, SC-001)

**Question**: According to the preface, why are humanoid robots significant for "inheriting our world"?

**Options**:
- A) They look aesthetically pleasing and human-like
- B) Infrastructure compatibility - doors, stairs, tools designed for human form ✅ **CORRECT**
- C) They are cheaper to manufacture than wheeled robots
- D) They move faster and more efficiently than other robot types

**Learning Objective**: Students explain the infrastructure compatibility argument for humanoid form factor

**Bloom's Level**: Understand

**Explanation**: Humanoid robots can navigate environments built for humans (doors, stairs, elevators) and use tools designed for human hands. Additionally, they can learn from the vast library of human video data (YouTube, TikTok).

## Question 4: Three Laws of Physical AI (FR-004, SC-001)

**Question**: Match each "Law of Physical AI" to its correct description:

**Law 1**: The Body Shapes the Mind
**Law 2**: Simulation is the New Training Ground
**Law 3**: Language is the Universal Interface

**Matching**:
- **Law 1** → A robot's physical form (kinematics, sensors) determines what it can learn ✅ **CORRECT**
- **Law 2** → Digital twins (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) allow safe testing before hardware ✅ **CORRECT**
- **Law 3** → Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable human-robot communication ✅ **CORRECT**

**Learning Objective**: Students recall and explain the Three Laws with concrete examples

**Bloom's Level**: Understand

**Explanation**: The Three Laws are foundational principles - embodiment shapes cognition (Law 1), simulation enables risk-free learning (Law 2), and language bridges human-robot interaction (Law 3).

---

## Question 5: Four-Phase Course Structure (FR-010, SC-004)

**Question**: What are the four major phases of the Physical AI course in the correct order?

**Options**:
- A) Setup → Development → Testing → Deployment
- B) Theory → Simulation → Hardware → Integration
- C) Nervous System (ROS 2) → Digital Twin (Simulation) → AI Brain (Navigation/Perception) → Voice of Action (Language) ✅ **CORRECT**
- D) Foundation Models → Edge Computing → Robotics → Ethics

**Learning Objective**: Students articulate the four-phase course structure and understand sequential dependencies

**Bloom's Level**: Understand

**Success Threshold**: 95%+ recall (SC-004)

**Explanation**: The course progresses through: (1) Nervous System (ROS 2 fundamentals), (2) Digital Twin (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim), (3) AI Brain (perception, navigation, learning), (4) Voice of Action (language models for human-robot interaction). Each module builds on the last.

## Bonus Question (Optional): Technology Identification (SC-005)

**Question**: Which of the following technologies will you use in this course? (Select at least 3 out of 5 correctly for SC-005)

**Options** (multiple select):
- A) ROS 2 Humble or Jazzy ✅ **CORRECT**
- B) TensorFlow only (no PyTorch)
- C) NVIDIA Isaac Sim ✅ **CORRECT**
- D) Gazebo Harmonic ✅ **CORRECT**
- E) Unreal Engine 5 (primary simulator)
- F) Whisper (OpenAI speech recognition) ✅ **CORRECT**
- G) VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models ✅ **CORRECT**

**Learning Objective**: Students identify at least 3 specific technologies by name (SC-005: 3/5 correct)

**Bloom's Level**: Remember

**Explanation**: The course uses ROS 2 (Humble/Jazzy), simulation platforms (Isaac Sim, Gazebo), speech recognition (Whisper), and VLA models for multimodal robot control.
