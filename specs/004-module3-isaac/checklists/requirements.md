# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Summary**: The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for planning. The module is organized into 3 clear chapters with prioritized user stories, comprehensive functional requirements (20 FRs), measurable success criteria (9 SCs + 6 LOs), and well-defined edge cases.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear progression: P1 (Simulation) → P2 (VSLAM) → P3 (Navigation)
- Each chapter is independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined assumptions and dependencies

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan
- All 3 chapters map clearly to functional requirements
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous
