# Preface: Welcome to the AI-Native Era

## The Moment Everything Changes

[Content to be written: 150-250 words, emotional hook, inclusive language ("you are standing at the threshold")]

## From Mind to Body: The Great Awakening

[Content to be written: 400-600 words, FR-001 Physical AI definition, FR-002 three technological tsunamis (Foundation Models, Simulation Environments, Edge Computing)]

## Why Humanoid? Why Now?

[Content to be written: 300-500 words, FR-003 infrastructure compatibility, learning from human video data]

## The Three Laws of Physical AI

[Content to be written: 600-800 words, FR-004 three laws with concrete examples:
- Law 1: The Body Shapes the Mind
- Law 2: Simulation is the New Training Ground
- Law 3: Language is the Universal Interface]

## What You Will Build

[Content to be written: 500-700 words, FR-005 four components:
- The Spinal Cord (ROS 2)
- The Imagination (Gazebo & Isaac Sim)
- The Cerebellum (Navigation & Control)
- The Cortex (Vision-Language-Action)

FR-006 technologies list: ROS 2 Humble/Jazzy, Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Whisper, VLA models]

## The Tools of Creation

[Content to be written: 200-400 words, FR-006 technologies, three-tier hardware structure, industry validation (Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, Figure AI)]

## The Weight of Responsibility

[Content to be written: 300-500 words, FR-007 safety/ethics with concrete failure mode examples: "A bug in a web app causes frustration. A bug in embodied AI can cause injury."]

## The Path Ahead

[Content to be written: 200-400 words, FR-008 difficulty acknowledgment ("wrestle with coordinate frames", "debug launch files at 2 AM") + motivation ("moments of pure wonder")]

## Your Place in History

[Content to be written: 200-400 words, FR-011 position as builders ("You are the students who will build the Physical AI revolution"), career relevance, historical parallel (CS 1975, ML 2015, Physical AI 2025)]

## A Final Word Before We Begin

[Content to be written: 300-500 words, FR-009 historical framing (HAL 9000 1968, Terminator 1984, David 2001), modern validation ("56 years, but we are finally building the reality"), FR-012 inclusive call to action ("Take a breath. Look around at your peers.")]

## How to Use This Course

[Content to be written: 300-500 words, FR-010 four-phase structure with sequential dependencies:
- Nervous System: ROS 2 fundamentals
- Digital Twin: Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim
- AI Brain: Perception, navigation, learning on Isaac
- Voice of Action: Language models for human-robot interaction

"Each module builds on the last. Skip nothing."]
