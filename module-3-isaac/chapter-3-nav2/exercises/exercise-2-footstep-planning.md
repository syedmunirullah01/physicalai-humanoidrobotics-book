# Exercise 2: Footstep Planning for Bipedal Navigation

## Objective
Implement and test footstep planning capabilities for bipedal humanoid robots using Isaac ROS Nav2.

## Prerequisites
- Exercise 1 completed
- Robot with bipedal locomotion capability
- URDF with leg joints defined
- Isaac ROS footstep planner installed

## Steps

### 1. Verify Robot Configuration
1. Check that your robot URDF includes leg joints and foot links
2. Verify joint limits and safety parameters
3. Confirm IMU and pose estimation are working

### 2. Launch Footstep Planning
1. Start your robot simulation or hardware
2. Launch VSLAM for localization:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch isaac_ros_vslam vslam-sim.launch.py
   ```
3. Launch Nav2 with footstep planning enabled:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch isaac_ros_nav2 nav2-sim.launch.py
   ```

### 3. Configure Footstep Parameters
1. Edit the footstep planning parameters in `nav2-params.yaml`
2. Set appropriate step size (typically 0.3m for humanoid robots)
3. Configure step height and width based on robot capabilities
4. Set maximum step constraints for safe locomotion

### 4. Test Footstep Planning
1. In RViz, enable the "Footsteps" visualization
2. Set a navigation goal that requires careful footstep planning
3. Observe the footstep path generated by the planner
4. Watch how the robot executes the planned footsteps

### 5. Navigate Complex Terrain
1. Create a map with obstacles or uneven terrain
2. Set navigation goals that require stepping around obstacles
3. Observe how the footstep planner generates safe stepping sequences
4. Monitor robot stability during execution

## Expected Results
- Footstep path visualized in RViz
- Robot executes stable bipedal locomotion
- Footsteps avoid obstacles and unsafe terrain
- Navigation completes successfully

## Advanced Challenges
- Test on sloped surfaces
- Navigate through narrow passages
- Handle dynamic obstacles with footstep replanning
- Integrate with upper body manipulation during navigation

## Troubleshooting
- If footsteps don't appear, check footstep planner node status
- If robot falls, reduce step size and velocity
- If planning fails, verify URDF joint limits
- If navigation is unstable, tune controller parameters

## Next Steps
- Try Exercise 3: Recovery Behaviors
- Experiment with terrain adaptation
- Test multi-step planning for complex environments
