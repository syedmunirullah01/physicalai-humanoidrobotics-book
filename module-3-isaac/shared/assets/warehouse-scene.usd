# Placeholder warehouse scene for Isaac Sim

This file represents a warehouse scene for Isaac Sim. In a real implementation, this would be a USD (Universal Scene Description) file containing the 3D scene definition.

For educational purposes in Module 3, this serves as the base environment where learners will:
- Create photorealistic simulation environments
- Configure virtual sensors
- Generate synthetic datasets
- Test VSLAM algorithms
- Validate navigation in known environments

## Scene Description

The warehouse scene includes:
- Concrete floors with realistic textures
- Metal shelving units with various objects
- Industrial lighting (LED panels)
- Loading dock area with forklifts
- Safety barriers and markings
- Standard warehouse dimensions (50m x 30m x 8m)

## Usage in Module 3

This scene is referenced in:
- Chapter 1: Isaac Sim simulation exercises
- Chapter 2: VSLAM testing with known ground truth
- Chapter 3: Navigation validation in structured environment

## Isaac Sim Integration

To load this scene in Isaac Sim:
1. Open Isaac Sim
2. File → Open → Select this USD file
3. Configure sensors as needed for exercises
4. Run simulation

## Technical Specifications

- Format: USD (Universal Scene Description)
- Units: Meters
- Lighting: Physically-based rendering
- Textures: 4K resolution for realism
- Physics: Enabled for dynamic objects

## Educational Objectives

Using this scene, learners will:
- Understand USD scene composition
- Configure RGB, depth, and stereo cameras
- Generate synthetic datasets with ground truth
- Validate perception algorithms
- Test navigation in realistic environments

## Note

This is a placeholder file. The actual USD scene would contain the complete 3D definition and would be created using Isaac Sim's scene creation tools or downloaded from the Isaac Sim assets library.
